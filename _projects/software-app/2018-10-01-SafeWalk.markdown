##### This mobile app was a project for **HackPrinceton 2016**. My team was selected to give a demo on the final showcase.

### Description

Safety of kids on their way to school and on their way home has always been a big concern for parents. Our app provides a way for parents to track kids' safety on their way using location of kids provided by the Google Maps API.

### Implementation

We implemented the app using Android Studio and made use of the Google Maps API to retrive real-time location of users. Whenever a child starts walking home from school, they can click on the "start" button and we will send the location information of user to our back-end database. Based on the destination location entered by the user, we use the Google Maps API to provide an estimate of how much time is needed along the way. Our backend will send the parent an email when the walk starts or when the walk takes much longer than expected. We also designed a "help" button on the main page so that the kid can click on the button in case of emergency and our backend will immediately send an email to the parents to notify them.
